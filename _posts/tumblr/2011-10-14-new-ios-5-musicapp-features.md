Apart from the name change from iPod to Music, there have been some significant improvements to the music player in Apple’s latest version of iOS.

## Smart Playlist Updating

Firstly, it appears that Smart Playlists actually _update in real time on the device_. This means that a track on my **Unplayed** playlist moves into my **Recent** playlist once I’ve listened to it. I may have been doing something wrong previously but I could never get it to work on my iPhone. It used to work on my non-iOS iPods and I’m glad to see it back. It essentially means I can work through unplayed music across multiple listening sessions without syncing.

## Handling Long Metadata Text

If you listen to vast quantities of classical or otherwise pretentious music (as I do), long artist names and track names will be commonplace.

There are two elegant solutions new in iOS 5 that will allow you to differentiate your Bernstein Mahler from your Norrington Mahler (apart from the vibrato of course!).

### Tap and hold tracks in a list

Long artist, track or album text on any given track can be viewed in a playlist/album context by simply tapping and holding the track name.

### Scrolling long text during playback

Album, track and artist text will scroll until every letter of each line has been shown.

## Wireless Sync

Finally, this is what it looks like whilst you’re loading up on Duke over the Wi-Fi.
