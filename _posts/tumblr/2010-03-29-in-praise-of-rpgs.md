The experiences of a mostly casual gamer, tackling the RPG genre. A kind of newbie introduction.

#### Background

Looking back on games that have consumed me over the years, I notice many of them have elements of role-playing. I think of _Championship Manager 93-94_, _Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and _[Outcast](http://www.outcast-thegame.com/ "Outcast PC CD-Rom")_ (a much overlooked gem).

#### Exploring RPG Options for the uninitiated

I approached the RPG genre proper. I was spurred on recently by the _Mass Effect 2_ and _Dragon Age: Origins_ phenomenon. Not having an XBOX or PC, I was encouraged by the [those in-the-know](http://twitter.com/waarg "@waarg") to explore BioWare’s older catalogue. Using the phenomenal [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/about/) software, I was able to get a gaming rig going on my [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Asus eee PC 901. I started playing with _Knights of the Old Republic_ and _Baldur’s Gate_.

Obviously these games are deep and involved so I need to be careful about drawing conclusions after a couple of hours’ play.

I am also that dufus on the tube leaning against the door with an iPhone, so I thought I’d check out my RPG options on this established gaming platform. I’m liking [Zenonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenonia), [Dungeon Hunter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqs7kHgLN9M "Dungeon Hunter Trailer: YouTube") and [Underworlds](http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=73612 "Underworlds Review"). I’ll be using screens from these games to brighten up this otherwise boring-looking post.

#### Initial Observations

Having been tinkering with various RPGs for a week or two, here are the main concepts to grasp. These features are observed to a greater or lesser extent in the games I’ve tried.

- Characterage
- Questage
- Levelage
- Equipage

Allow me to elaborate along these lines…

##### Characterage

You need to pick the race of your character before you start. The world in which the RPG is set will dictate what kind of beings you can control. The only way I can think of expressing the range of RPG characters is as a [Python](http://diveintopython.org/native_data_types/index.html#odbchelper.dict "Python datatypes: Dictionaries") dictionary.

    characterage = {
        ('warlock', 'wizard', 'mage'): "frail dude, lots of spells, useful to have at the back to throw fire at baddies",
        ('soldier', 'warrior'): "good to have at the front swinging a two-handed sword",
        ('thief', 'assassin', 'rogue'): "stealthy, sly buggers, useful in towns and a closing-time ruckus",
        ('ranger', 'scout'): "enigmatic types, to be found in dark, candlelit corners of the Inn",
        'paladin': "the Holy fool, Parsifal, class and therefore my first choice",
        'all female characters': "pole-dancers with pointy ears. Russ Meyer meets Tolkein.",
    }

I quite like the ranger option, identifying with Aragorn/Strider from Lord of the Rings, but the [paladin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladin) is a more commonly available character. The paladin is a Holy Knight from the court of Charlemagne, unflinching in the service of Good. You need to overlook the fact that this effectively makes you a crusading, Christian fundamentalist lest our _Candlewind Guardian_-reading sensibilities be offended.

Character classes are a fine way of capturing your imagination. Anybody who has grown up reading Lord of the Rings, watching [Dungeons & Dragons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfif5DiGMYc "Dungeons & Dragons Intro Video")or has had even the slightest exposure to [Arthurian romance and legend](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/831 "Four Arthurian Romances by 12th cent. de Troyes Chrétien - Project Gutenberg")should instinctively find a character that fits their personality. These characters are not just a niche fantasy but are part of a (mostly Western) folk tradition of story-telling.

##### Questage

The quest is an easy thing to get a handle on. You and your character will likely be starting a journey, often for unclear reasons; no dramatic irony here. As the main story is revealed to you, you will meet other characters asking you to run small errands and giving you snippets of information. You might have to deliver a letter because too many messengers have been shot or put several noisy baddies to the sword as they are making reading difficult in the castle library. As you complete these quests, you will receive gold for equipment and experience points that will contribute to your character’s level.

##### Levelage

_Leveling up_ is a phrase entering common, non-gaming parlance. Your character gains experience through achievements, like completing tasks and beating up baddies. You are assigned a simple, incremental number (1,2,3), designating your current level. Once your experience reaches a given threshold, you _Level up_. Like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, your new level bestows new abilities upon you. You may be able to wield more powerful weapons or take on fiercer opponents.

[![The green bar at the bottom indicates I am over a quarter of the way to my next level. I have a rather fatter, more pressing matter at hand here.](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4460082981_1bf81ab517_d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/richbs/4460082981/)_The green bar at the bottom indicates I am over a quarter of the way to my next level. I have a rather fatter, more pressing matter at hand here._

You’ll also be able to increase certain metrics on your character, like strength or endurance.

When entering into combat with a foe, you will usually see a dialog box describing the opponent’s health and level. If it is of a level significantly higher than yours, you might be better going back to the village and running a few errands to gain more experience. Your attacks will then have more effect on the foe and, in turn, its attacks may cause you less grief.

[![This Level 9 Slime is no match for axe-and-dagger combination.](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4473767267_e6cbbff8a0_d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/richbs/4473767267/)_This Level 9 Slime is no match for axe-and-dagger combination._

Sometimes you can find yourself beating up numerous weaker enemies in order to inflate your experience, outside the normal narrative of the game, in order to progress. Experienced gamers often regard this as flaw in game design, known as _grinding_. However, I tend to find this quite therapeutic and it reflects the satisfying free-form nature of some RPGs.

##### Equipage

A key part of working the RPG genre is tooling up your character. You may be able to buy equipment from a rotund merchant or innkeeper in your nearest village or town. You will have acquired gold from completing quests, opening boxes or thieving from rooms at the Inn. You can then equip bits of of your body; gloves and gauntlets for the arms; tunics and armour for the torso; swords, bludgeons and shields for the hands. To carry the best weapons, you’ll need more than gold; you may need to be at a certain level to even lift a two-handed sword.

[![The choice of armaments can be impressive.](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4460863184_287979ab7c_d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/richbs/4460863184/)_The choice of armaments can be impressive._

##### In Conclusion

The distilled RPG format that can be found on the iPhone games above has assisted me in understanding the mechanics of the game play. I’m not, at this stage, talking about the MMORPGs, like _World of Warcraft_ (awesome as they are).

I’ll continue playing _Knights of the Old Republic_ and _Baldur’s Gate_ and see what complexities and subtleties lie therein. I hope too to be able to play the latest breed of action RPGs, such as _Dragon Age_ and _Mass Effect_ on a friend’s XBox 360 in the not too distant future.
