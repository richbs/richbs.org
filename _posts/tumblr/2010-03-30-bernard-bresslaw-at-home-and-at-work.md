I love it when collections of web data make the unlikely connections.

My [colleague](http://twitter.com/waarg) and I were delighted to see the [Harry Hammond](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/name/hammond-harry/47561/) photography collection fully digitised on the V&A Search the Collections database a couple of months back. This is a collection worth exploring…

There are some extraordinary photographs from the fifties and sixties here. _Update: I just realised I should link to these images rather than display them inline, due to copyright issues! Don’t want the people downstairs coming after me…_

[Elvis Presley at Glasgow Prestwick Airport](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1148731/photographic-negative/)

All very nice. But what struck me today was that one of the sites I develop ([Film on Freeview](http://www.viewfilm.net/)) identified there was a glut (mostly from the _Carry On_ stable) of [films starring England’s 6’ 7½" comedy giant, Bernard Bresslaw](http://viewfilm.net/person/bernard-bresslaw) over the 2010 Easter holidays.

Much to our amusement, there are plenty of [photographs of Bernard Bresslaw](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/subject/bresslaw-bernard/38501/) in the Harry Hammond collection. And some are pure magic…
